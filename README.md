## Setup & Running (Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (v7+)
- MongoDB (Atlas account or local installation)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd job-app-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or use: `npm run install:all`

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `env.example` from the root directory to `server/.env`
   - Add the required values:
     ```env
     # MongoDB Connection String (Required)
     # Why: Used to connect to your MongoDB database where all application data is stored
     # How to get:
     #   - Local MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017/job-app-assistant
     #   - MongoDB Atlas: Create a free cluster at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
     #     Then copy the connection string from Atlas dashboard (replace <password> with your password)
     #     Example: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/job-app-assistant?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
     
     # JWT Secret Key (Required)
     # Why: Used to sign and verify JWT tokens for user authentication and session management
     # How to get: Generate a secure random string using one of these methods:
     #   - OpenSSL: openssl rand -base64 32
     #   - Node.js: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
     #   - Online: Use a secure random string generator (minimum 32 characters recommended)
     # Important: Keep this secret secure and never commit it to version control
     JWT_SECRET=<your_strong_random_secret_string>

     # Cloudinary Configuration (Optional - for persistent profile images)
     # Why: Hosts user profile images efficiently and reliably in production
     # How to get: Create a free account at https://cloudinary.com
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloud_name>
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
     ```

4. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both:
   - Backend server (nodemon on port 5001)
   - Frontend server (Vite on port 5173)
